[CrossnoKaye](https://crossnokaye.com/)

I work on the Applied Science team developing EnergyAI, a cloud-native platform for optimizing heavy industrial systems. My focus is on designing optimization algorithms and the data and infrastructure needed to deploy them at scale. This includes high-frequency telemetry, monitoring systems, and measurement and verification workflows.

## Lockheed Martin – Advanced Energy  
*2018 – 2020*  
[Lockheed Martin: long-duration energy storage system for the U.S. Army](https://news.lockheedmartin.com/2022-6-14-lockheed-martin-to-build-first-long-duration-energy-storage-system-for-us-army)

I worked on the development and testing of a long-duration flow battery for grid-scale energy storage, spanning hands-on experimental work, data analysis, and internal tooling. My responsibilities included assembling and operating experimental systems, designing and executing test plans, analyzing and validating performance data, authoring technical reports, building Python-based analysis and reporting tools, and developing a machine-learning model to predict stack resistance with sub-5% error.
